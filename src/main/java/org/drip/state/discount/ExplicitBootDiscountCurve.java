/**
 * ExplicitBootDiscountCurve exposes the functionality associated with the bootstrapped Discount Curve.
 *  - Generate a curve shifted using targeted basis at specific nodes.
 *  - Generate scenario tweaked Latent State from the base forward curve corresponding to mode adjusted
 *  	(flat/parallel/custom) manifest measure/quantification metric.
 *  - Retrieve array of latent state manifest measure, instrument quantification metric, and the array of
 *  	calibration components.
 *  - Set/retrieve curve construction input instrument sets.
