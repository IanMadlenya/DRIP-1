Features:
	- Deferral of the Stream's outstanding FX-adjusted notional onto the containing period
	- Elimination of FX MTM Setting, and its dependence on streams
	- Explicit setting of all the bracketing trending - hints to indicate trending inside of current soft zone in search of valid starter
	- Migration of all the Reset period related utilities from PeriodUtil onto ResetUtil
	- Eliminate implicit maturity impact on end-of-month date Adjustments
	- Trim out Terminal Date Dependence of Coupon Period
	- Coupon Period Set Builder now explicitly exposes the FX Fixing Date on a per coupon period basis
	- Remove Fix/Float Stream based FX Fixing Date setting, and simplification of the stream's coupon period upgrade

Bug Fixes:
	- Reset Period Compounding Convexity Adjustment to be computed from the Fixing Date, not the Reset Period Start Date
	- Terminal Date and FX Fixing Dates Switched in the Period Generator Schemes; Further ARITHMETIC compounding is used where GEOMETRIC is appropriate
