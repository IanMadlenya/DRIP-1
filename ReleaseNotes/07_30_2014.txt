Features:
	- Merged Discount/Forward States Discount/Forward Curve Generation: Constraints Setting Infrastructure
	- Merged Discount/Forward States Constraints Generation: Fixed and Floating Streams
	- Merged Discount/Forward States Constraints Generation: Deposits, EDF, FRA, Fix-Float, Float-Float, and IRS Components
	- Latent State Identification Specification - Incorporation of the Latent State Type, the Label, and the Quantification Metric into the Quote Set
	- Incorporation of the Latent State Specification into stream/product calibration constraint generation
	- Multi Latent-State Calibration Specification and base match set up infrastructure
	- Streams and Components match verification for the multi Latent-State calibration runs

Bug Fixes:
	- EDFComponent is to be treated as a Forward Rate Dependent Product (just like FRA and Deposit)
	- Latent State Merge Label Set: Set this merge Lables on a generated Response Constraint basis, not on a Component Label Set Basis (as well extend it to all Latent States)
