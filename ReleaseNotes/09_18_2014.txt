Features:
	- "Moneyness Factor" measure for STIR Option, FRA Caplet/Floorlet, and Cap/floor
	- Option Intrinsic value Value in Manifest Measure Units for STIR and caplet/floorlet options
	- Intrinsic-to-PV tranformer - Transformation based on Manifest Measure Sizings

Bug Fixes:
	- STIR Option - No explicit Integrated Quanto Drift - already incorporated into the ATM/moneyness of par swap rate
	- STIR Option - Vol surface is that of the par forward swap rate custom surface, indexed using component name/manifest measure labels
	- CCBS Discount Curve Latent State Setup QM Spec Bug - QM should be DISCOUNT_FACTOR in place of ZERO_RATE
	- CCBS Component Pair Creation Bug - The Constituent Components need to of opposite notionals to netout on their bais-adjusted PV's

Samples:
	- STIR Option based samples - Custom Metric vol surface to be added for component name/manifest measure custom metric labels
	- STIR/Cap/Floor Option Samples - Incorporation of Manifest Measure Intrinsic Value, and their PV basis
	- CCBS Calibration Measure Mark Bug - the fix-float Calibration measure should be "SwapRate" in place of "DerivedParBasisSpread"
