Features:
	- Multiple FRI per component: CMP enhancement for named FRI-specific Forward Curve set/retrieval/access
	- Multiple FRI per component: Component Extensions for FRI-specific leg pricing, calibration, and sensitivity generation

Bug Fixes:
	- SIGNIFICANT Fix: Extension of the Rates Segment Sequence Builder to multiple stretches through the span connector
	- Fix-Float Swap Enhancement for Calibration of Forward Curve through Derived Basis Par Spread and Fixed Swap Rates
