Features:
	- Bullet Cash flow - Base Metrics Generation and the funding discount factor loadings generation
	- Bullet Cash flow - serialization/de-serialization
	- Bullet Cash Flow Metrics - Seeting up of the Matrics definition and latent state point loadings generation
	- Elimination of fixed and IBOR floating stream generator in Rates Stream Builder in favor of the more general interface
	- Elimination of the highly customed PeriodBuilder calls
	- Stream Measures List

Bug Fixes:
	- FRA Caplet/Floorlet Pricing bug - there should be no impact on the drift, as that already occurs inside off of the moneyness.

Samples:
	- Updates to incorporate Rates Stream Elimination in favor of using the Period Builder generic interface
	- Updates to incorporate custom PeriodBuilder calls in favor of using the generic PeriodBuilder calls
	- FRA Options (incl. Caplet/Floorlet, and cap/floor) - Sample now uses a "realistic strike" that is in the range of the underlying FRA
